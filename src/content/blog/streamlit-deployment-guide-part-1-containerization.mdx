When I needed to create a quick proof of concept (PoC) using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), I faced two constraints:

- Self-hosted instead of using [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud).
- Control access to the deployed website.

With this in mind, containerizing the application and hosting it on Azure was the best solution with my skillset. This post kicks off a series detailing the process, broken down into the following parts:

- **Part 1**: Containerizing a Streamlit app. **You are here** ðŸ˜Š
- **Part 2**: GitHub Workflow for Building and Publishing to ghcr.io
- **Part 3**: Azure Infrastructure via Terraform
- **Part 4**: GitHub Workflow for Terraform Apply & Destroy

Do you want to deploy your Streamlit application on Azure right now? Use the [template repository](https://github.com/WayneGoosen/azure-streamlit-poc) ï¿½

## TL;DR

Read the [completed Dockerfile](#completed-dockerfile), execute commands to [build the image](#build-the-docker-image) and [run the container](#run-the-docker-container).

## Streamlit Application Files

Before proceeding with the steps, ensure the following Streamlit application files are available. You can find these files in the [app folder](https://github.com/WayneGoosen/azure-streamlit-poc/tree/main/app) of the GitHub repository.

### .streamlit/config.toml

```toml
[client]
showErrorDetails = false
toolbarMode = "auto"
showSidebarNavigation = true

[theme]
base = "dark"

[logger]
level = "debug"
messageFormat = "%(asctime)s %(message)s"

[server]
port = 80

[browser]
gatherUsageStats = false
```

### app.py

```python
import os
import streamlit as st

st.title("Streamlit on Azure ï¿½")
st.header('Running on a Web App in a Container ï¿½', divider='rainbow')
```

### requirements.txt

```
streamlit
```

## Create a Dockerfile

**Note:** Docker is a prerequisite, read the [install documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for more details.

### Completed Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim

LABEL maintainer="Wayne Goosen" \
      version="1.0.0" \
      description="Streamlit template for Docker. Uses app.py as the main file."

WORKDIR /app

RUN apt-get update \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

COPY requirements.txt .

RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt

COPY .streamlit/config.toml .streamlit/
COPY app.py .

RUN groupadd -g 1005 appgroup && \
    useradd -u 1005 -g appgroup appuser && \
    chown -R appuser:appgroup /app

EXPOSE 80

USER appuser

ENTRYPOINT ["streamlit", "run"]
CMD ["app.py"]
```

### Dockerfile Walkthrough

#### Specify Base Image

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim
```

- Uses a slim version of Python 3.9 as the base image, ensuring a minimal and efficient environment.

#### Add Metadata Labels

```dockerfile
LABEL maintainer="Wayne Goosen" \
      version="1.0.0" \
      description="Streamlit template for Docker. Uses app.py as the main file."
```

- Provides metadata about the Docker image, including the maintainer, version, and description.

#### Set Working Directory

```dockerfile
WORKDIR /app
```

- Sets the working directory inside the container to `/app`.
- Note: Streamlit version 1.10.0 and higher, Streamlit apps cannot be run from the root directory of Linux distributions.

#### Update Package List

```dockerfile
RUN apt-get update \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

- Updates the package list for the APT package manager and then removes the cached package lists to reduce image size.

#### Copy Requirements File

```dockerfile
COPY requirements.txt .
```

- Copies `requirements.txt` from the host machine to the current working directory in the container (`/app`).

#### Install Python Dependencies

```dockerfile
RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

- Installs the Python dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` using `pip`.

#### Copy Configuration and Application Files

```dockerfile
COPY .streamlit/config.toml .streamlit/
COPY app.py .
```

- Copies the Streamlit configuration file and the main application file (`app.py`) into the container. Separated to support caching.

#### Create Dedicated Application User and Group

```dockerfile
RUN groupadd -g 1005 appgroup && \
    useradd -u 1005 -g appgroup appuser && \
    chown -R appuser:appgroup /app
```

- Creates a new group `appgroup` with GID 1005.
- Creates a new user `appuser` with UID 1005 and adds it to `appgroup`.
- Changes the ownership of the `/app` directory to `appuser:appgroup`.

#### Expose Port

```dockerfile
EXPOSE 80
```

- Informs Docker that the container will listen on port 80 at runtime.

#### Switch to Non-Root User

    ```dockerfile
    USER appuser
    ```
    - Switches to the newly created `appuser` to run the application, enhancing security.

#### Set Entry Point and Command

    ```dockerfile
    ENTRYPOINT ["streamlit", "run"]
    CMD ["app.py"]
    ```
    - Sets the entry point (command that runs when a container starts) to `streamlit run`, and the default command to `app.py`, which runs the Streamlit application. This approach allows you to run the container with your custom parameters to `streamlit run`

## Build the Docker Image

To build the Docker image, navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile and run the following command:

```bash
docker build -t streamlit-app .
```

TheÂ -tÂ flag is used to tag the image. Here, we have tagged the imageÂ streamlit-app. If you run:

```bash
docker images
```

You should see aÂ streamlit-appÂ image under the REPOSITORY column. For example:

| REPOSITORY    | TAG    | IMAGE ID     | CREATED            | SIZE  |
| ------------- | ------ | ------------ | ------------------ | ----- |
| streamlit-app | latest | 70b0759a094d | About a minute ago | 628MB |

## Run the Docker Container

To run the Docker container, use the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 8501:80 streamlit-app:latest
```

To view your app, browse toÂ http://0.0.0.0:8501Â orÂ http://localhost:8501

## Streamlit Configuration

In order to provide Streamlit configuration, there are two approaches:

- config.toml file ([What is TOML?](https://toml.io/))
- command line parameters

In this example it uses the config.toml and you can find more configuration options in the [documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/configuration/config.toml). Below I will showcase an example setting the port below using both approaches.

### Config.toml

```toml
[server]
port = 80
```

### Parameters

```bash
streamlit run app.py --server.port=80
```
